mosc-curated-list

This repository is the primary data source for the curated app. It has a client and a server. It is live at curated.bvpmosc.tech.

The goal is to have few high-quality choices so that developpers can quickly find the best package for their need. Only a handful of packages will be accepted for each category.

The list of curated packages are written in the PACKAGES.md markdown file. This file contains the data in a special format design to be still easily readable without parser.

Example:

# Category label
How to add a package

A package is a bullet-point line followed by some fields formatted in a particualiar way. It will be parsed by the mosc-curated app.

The row just starts with a link to the package repository, whose label is used as the package name in the app.

Each field is separated by a comma , and the value is put after colons :.

Example:

- [name](link), field1:value, field2:value, field3:value
Some fields can contain a list of values which are separated by a pipe | (without spaces).

Example:

array_field:value1|value2|value3
